# Radio-Millimeter-Submillimeter (RMS) Interferometry-Community-Software
Curated list of interferometric software, methods and techniques

*This list was developed during the 2024 Spatio-spectral Modeling for Interferometric Data Workshop (go.nrao.edu/ssmid)*

## Software Packages

- [CASA](https://casadocs.readthedocs.io/)


### Visibilities and Imaging
- [pyuvdata](https://pyuvdata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- [casangi](https://github.com/casangi)

- [MPoL](https://mpol-dev.github.io/MPoL/)


### Analysis
- [radio-astro-tools](https://radio-astro-tools.github.io) -- spectral-cube, radio-beam, pvextractor, casa-formats-io
- [bettermoments](https://bettermoments.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- 

  
## Methods, Techniques, and Tutorials

- [radio-astro-tools tutorials](https://radio-astro-tools.github.io/tutorials/) -- tutorials on using spectral-cube, fitting with spectral-cube, parallelization with dask, creating position-velocity diagrams, signal masking and moment map creation, cube reprojection
- [Visread: Examining DSHARP AS 209 Weights and Exporting Visibilities](https://mpol-dev.github.io/visread/tutorials/rescale_AS209_weights.html) -- uses CASA tools to examine the visibilities, visibility residuals, and weights of a real multi-configuration dataset from the DSHARP survey.
